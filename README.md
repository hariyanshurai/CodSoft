Calculator Project
Overview
This project is a simple calculator application implemented in [python language]. The calculator provides various mathematical operations, each implemented as a separate function. Users can input two numbers and choose an operation by entering a corresponding number. The program is designed to handle errors gracefully, and users can exit the application at any point.

Features
Addition Function: Perform addition of two numbers.

Subtraction Function: Perform subtraction of two numbers.

Multiplication Function: Perform multiplication of two numbers.

Division Function: Perform division of two numbers.

Exponent Function: Utilizes the math module to calculate the exponent of the sum of two numbers.

Square Root Function: Utilizes the math module to calculate the square root of a number.

Continuous Calculations: Users can choose to continue with additional calculations without restarting the program.

Graceful Program Exit: Users have the option to exit the program at any point.

Usage
To run the calculator, follow these steps:

Enter two numbers when prompted.

Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number.

View the result of the operation.

Choose whether to continue with additional calculations or exit the program.

Code Structure
The project is organized into separate functions to handle specific mathematical operations:

addition(): Function to perform addition.
subtraction(): Function to perform subtraction.
multiplication(): Function to perform multiplication.
division(): Function to perform division.
exponent(): Function to calculate the exponent of the sum of two numbers.
square_root(): Function to calculate the square root of a number.
The program uses a while True loop to enable continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.

Error Handling
The program incorporates error handling mechanisms to catch and handle unexpected inputs, such as ValueError when the user enters an invalid value. This ensures a smooth and error-free user experience.

To-Do List Project
<br>
Overview
<br>
This project is a simple To-Do List application implemented in [python language]. It provides users with the ability to add new tasks, delete tasks, and view their task list. The program is designed with proper error handling and features a menu-driven interface to enhance user experience.

Features
Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the list by selecting the corresponding option from the menu.

Delete Task: The program allows users to delete tasks from their list. Proper error handling is implemented to ensure smooth execution.

View Task List: Users can view their entire task list, making it easy to track their to-do items.

Go Back Functionality: A user-friendly feature allows users to go back to the main menu or previous steps in the process.

Graceful System Breakout: The program provides a safe and graceful way for users to exit the system.

Usage
To run the program, follow these steps:

Choose the desired action from the menu:

To add a new task, select the corresponding option.
To delete a task, choose the delete option and follow the prompts.
To view the task list, select the appropriate option.
Follow the on-screen instructions for each action.

Code Structure
The project is organized into separate functions to handle specific tasks:

add_task(): Function to add a new task to the list.
delete_task(): Function to delete a task from the list.
view_task_list(): Function to display the current task list.
Error Handling
Proper error handling mechanisms are implemented to catch and handle unexpected inputs or issues, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience.
